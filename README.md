## How to play
In this game you'll be playing against the dealer only, and one deck will be used.

The objective is either to obtain a blackjack (Ace + 10) or score as close to 21 as possible. If you go over 21, you bust and the dealer wins.

Number cards are worth their numerical value, face cards are worth 10, and Aces are worth either 11 or 1, depending on your current score.

The dealer will deal you your first card, deal himself a card, and then deal you your second card.

If you hit a blackjack and the dealer doesn't, you win.

Otherwise, decide whether you'll take another card (hit) or lock in your hand (stand).

Once you decide to stand, the dealer will start to deal himself cards until his score reaches at least 17.

If the dealer beats your score, you lose.
